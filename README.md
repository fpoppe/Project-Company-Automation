Project Company Automation
# Indicator Automation

### Objective: Train and create a Complete Project that involves automating a process done on the computer

### Description:

Imagine that you work in a large clothing store chain with 25 stores spread across Brazil.

Every day, in the morning, the data analysis team calculates the so-called One Pages and sends the OnePage of their store to the manager of each store, as well as all the information used in the calculation of the indicators.

A One Page is a very simple and to the point summary, used by the store management team to know the main indicators of each store and allow in 1 page (hence the name OnePage) both the comparison between different stores, as well as which indicators that one store managed to comply that day or not.

Your role, as a Data Analyst, is to be able to create a process as automatically as possible to calculate the OnePage for each store and send an email to the manager of each store with your OnePage in the body of the email and also the file complete with the details of your respective store attached.

E.g.: The email to be sent to the Store Manager A must be an example

### Important Files and Information

- Emails.xlsx file with the name, store and email of each manager. Note: I suggest replacing each manager's email column with an email from you, so you can test the result

- Sales.xlsx file with sales from all stores. Note: Each manager should only receive OnePage and an excel file attached with their store sales. Information from another store should not be sent to the manager who is not from that store.

- Stores.csv file with the name of each store

- At the end, your routine should also send an email to the board (information is also in the Emails.xlsx file) with 2 store rankings attached, 1 day ranking and another annual ranking. In addition, in the body of the email, it should be highlighted which was the best and worst store of the day and also the best and worst store of the year. The ranking of a store is given by the store's turnover.

- The spreadsheets for each store must be saved inside the store folder with the date of the spreadsheet in order to create a backup history

### OnePage Bookmarks

- Revenue -> Target Year: 1,650,000 / Target Day: 1000
- Product Diversity (how many different products were sold in that period) -> Target Year: 120 / Target Day: 4
- Average Ticket per Sale -> Target Year: 500 / Target Day: 500
